            </p>
            <p><strong>Project Objectives</strong></p>
            <p>This project involved the end-to-end deployment of a cloud-native recipe-sharing application that transformed a manual, offline process of sharing culinary content into a scalable, digital platform. Leveraging AWS services and modern DevOps practices, I provisioned the infrastructure using AWS CloudFormation, deployed the backend using FastAPI with Uvicorn on EC2, and hosted the frontend—built with React and TypeScript—on Amazon S3, integrating it with API Gateway for RESTful interactions. I created a dual interface: a user page for browsing and searching recipes, and an admin interface for content management. For monitoring and observability, I integrated Prometheus to scrape FastAPI metrics, collecting data on request rates, latency, and error frequencies, and visualized these metrics using Grafana dashboards. The system was designed for peak usage periods, particularly Fridays and Saturdays, and incorporated cost-efficiency strategies to accommodate global growth, targeting a user base of 100,000 for potential business partnerships with food delivery services.</p>

            </p>
            <p><strong>Project Objectives</strong></p>
            <p>This project entailed the creation and deployment of a secure and robust three-tier web application architecture leveraging AWS services and DevOps methodologies. The infrastructure was codified using Terraform, which provisioned a custom VPC complete with public/private subnets, NAT gateways, and route tables for secure traffic management. The frontend, built with static files, was hosted on Amazon S3, while the backend—developed in Node.js—was deployed to EC2 instances. CI/CD automation was achieved through GitHub Actions, linking development (dev) and production (main) branches to distinct environments. Every code commit triggered seamless deployment pipelines, reducing manual overhead and enabling continuous delivery. Monitoring was implemented using AWS CloudWatch for system metrics and AWS Managed Grafana for rich visual analytics. The integration of Systems Manager allowed automated agent installations and ongoing health checks, thus establishing a reliable and observable platform fit for scalable growth and enterprise-grade operations.</p>

            </p>
            <p><strong>Project Objectives</strong></p>
            <p>In this project, I architected and deployed a secure, containerized three-tier web application using Kubernetes on AWS. The system comprised a frontend presentation layer, a backend logic layer, and a persistent data layer. I used Terraform to provision an Amazon EKS cluster and configured VPC networking, IAM roles, and security groups. Docker was used to containerize application components, which were pushed to AWS ECR and deployed using Kubernetes manifests. To manage ingress traffic, I implemented the AWS ALB Ingress Controller. Monitoring was a core objective, so I enabled control plane logging via AWS CloudWatch to capture EKS API, audit, and authenticator logs. This project reflects my ability to design production-grade infrastructure with high availability, automated scaling, secure access control, and operational observability—all essential for real-world enterprise deployments.</p>

            </p>
            <p><strong>Project Objectives</strong></p>
            <p>This project encapsulated a full DevOps lifecycle, starting from infrastructure provisioning to continuous integration and deployment, culminating in full-stack observability. I utilized Terraform to deploy a secure and scalable AWS infrastructure comprising VPCs, subnets, EC2 instances, and IAM configurations. I implemented a GitHub Actions pipeline that automated code testing, container image builds, and image publishing to AWS ECR. The application was deployed on Amazon EKS using Kubernetes manifests with built-in redundancy and autoscaling. For monitoring, I configured Prometheus and Grafana dashboards, and centralized logging was managed using the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana). Security was enforced through IAM policies and HTTPS via SSL/TLS termination at the load balancer. This comprehensive pipeline emulates real-world enterprise DevOps workflows and validates my expertise in infrastructure as code, CI/CD, container orchestration, and proactive system monitoring.</p>
