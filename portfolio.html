          <h2>Secure Three-Tier Web Application Deployment on Kubernetes with AWS Monitoring</h2>
          <p><a href="https://github.com/OluwaTossin/Three-tier-Application-Deployment-" target="_blank">GitHub Repo</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/secure-three-tier-web-application-deployment-aws-oluwatosin-jegede-7fdif/" target="_blank">LinkedIn Article</a></p>
          <p>This project focused on deploying a secure, scalable three-tier web application using AWS and Kubernetes. I provisioned a robust EKS cluster and built Docker containers for both frontend and backend services, hosted securely via AWS ECR. To route traffic efficiently, I configured an ALB Ingress Controller. For observability, I enabled CloudWatch control plane logs to track API server activities, authenticator logs, and audits. The infrastructure was designed to scale dynamically, with IAM roles enforcing principle of least privilege across services.</p>
          <p class="services"><strong>Services Used:</strong> AWS EKS, IAM, Docker, ALB Ingress, CloudWatch, Terraform</p>

          <h2>Secure Three-Tier Web Application with GitHub Actions CI/CD, S3 Hosting, Deployment to Dev and Prod Servers, and Comprehensive Monitoring</h2>
          <p><a href="https://github.com/OluwaTossin/Three-tier-Application-Deployment-" target="_blank">GitHub Repo</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/secure-three-tier-web-application-github-actions-cicd-jegede-ikm4f/" target="_blank">LinkedIn Article</a></p>
          <p>In this project, I built a fully automated, environment-aware deployment pipeline for a three-tier web application. The frontend was hosted on S3 while the backend (Node.js) ran on EC2 within a VPC. GitHub Actions orchestrated CI/CD pipelines across dev and prod branches. Infrastructure was provisioned with Terraform, including private/public subnets and NAT gateways. For monitoring, I installed the CloudWatch agent and configured AWS Managed Grafana dashboards with real-time CPU, memory, and disk usage metrics. Alerts were created for SLA-sensitive events. This setup exemplifies production-grade DevOps and cloud architecture.</p>

          <p>To modernize the way I share culinary recipes, I developed and deployed a cloud-native FastAPI application integrated with a React frontend hosted on S3. The backend API was containerized and deployed to EC2, exposed via API Gateway. CloudFormation handled infrastructure provisioning. To ensure performance visibility, I configured Prometheus to scrape FastAPI metrics and visualized real-time traffic using Grafana dashboards. I designed two access layers: a user interface and an admin portal, reflecting real-world content management workflows.</p>

          <p>This project implemented a full-stack DevOps solution using GitHub Actions for CI, Terraform for infrastructure automation, and Kubernetes on AWS EKS for orchestration. Dockerized applications were built and deployed with Kubernetes manifests. Logs were centralized using the ELK stack, while Prometheus and Grafana enabled detailed performance monitoring and alerting. Security was reinforced through IAM policies, encrypted storage, and TLS via ACM certificates.</p>
